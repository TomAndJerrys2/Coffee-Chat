# CoffeeChat

A Chat application design for my family built in Modern React for a responsive
and fast web-design. Paired with Googles Firebase API for endpoint authentication,
Load balancing and Storage options - Coffee Chat makes for a streamlined, lightweight
tool that can be ran on almost any system or browser thanks to the Virtual DOM.

Built for friends, family and communication around the world. Coffee Chat has features
you would expect: Instant Messaging, Friend Lists, Connections and Stories, Group or Direct Messaging,
Privacy Settings, Compatible Encoding with Custom Gifs and Emojis.

- These Stats show the Client a rought model of the architecture and how it could be designed. There could be a lot more fields
however, to keep it simple for now we will focus just on users and messaging.
